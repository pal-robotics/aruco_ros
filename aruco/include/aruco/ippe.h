// This is the core header file for IPPE. Infinitesimal Plane-based Pose Estimation (IPPE) is a very fast and accurate
// way to compute a camera's pose from a single image of a planar object using point correspondences. This has uses in
// several applications, including augmented reality, 3D tracking and pose estimation with planar markers, and 3D scene
// understanding.

    /** @brief Finds the two possible poses of a square planar object given its four corner correspondences in an image
    using IPPE. These poses are sorted so that the first one is the one with the lowest reprojection error. The second
    pose is needed if the problem is ambiguous. The problem is ambiguous when the projection of the model is close to
    affine, which in practice happens if it is small or viewed from a large distance. In these cases there are two pose
    solutions that can correctly align the correspondences (up to noise), so it is impossible to select the right one
    from just the reprojection error. IPPE gives you both the solutions, rather than just a single solution (which in
    ambiguous cases would be wrong 50% of the time). Geometrically, the two poses roughly correspond to a reflection of
    the model about a plane whose normal passes through the line-of-sight from the camera centre to the model's centre.
    For more details about these ambiguities, please refer to the IPPE paper.
     *
     * It is possible to reject the second pose if its reprojection error is significantly worse than the first pose.
    The correct way to do this is with a likelihood ratio test (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood-ratio_test).

    @param squareLength the squares's length (which is also it's width) in object coordinate units (e.g. millimeters,
    meters, etc.)
    The square is defined in object coordinates on the plane z=0 and centred at the origin. Therefore its four points in
    object coordinates are given by:
      point 0: [-squareLength / 2.0, squareLength / 2.0, 0]
      point 1: [squareLength / 2.0, squareLength / 2.0, 0]
      point 2: [squareLength / 2.0, -squareLength / 2.0, 0]
      point 3: [-squareLength / 2.0, -squareLength / 2.0, 0]
    @param imagePoints Array of four corresponding image points, 1x4/4x1 2-channel. Note that the points should be
    ordered to correspond with points 0, 1, 2 and 3.
    @param cameraMatrix Input camera matrix \f$A = \vecthreethree{fx}{0}{cx}{0}{fy}{cy}{0}{0}{1}\f$ .
    @param distCoeffs Input vector of distortion coefficients
    \f$(k_1, k_2, p_1, p_2[, k_3[, k_4, k_5, k_6 [, s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4[, \tau_x, \tau_y]]]])\f$ of
    4, 5, 8, 12 or 14 elements. If the vector is NULL/empty, the zero distortion coefficients are
    assumed.
    @param _rvec1 Output rotation vector (see Rodrigues ) for first pose. That, together with tvec , brings points from
    the model coordinate system to the camera coordinate system.
    @param _tvec1 Output translation vector for first pose.
    @param reprojErr1 Output reprojection error of first pose
    @param _rvec2 Output rotation vector (see Rodrigues ) for second pose. That, together with tvec , brings points from
    the model coordinate system to the camera coordinate system.
