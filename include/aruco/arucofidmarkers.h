    * \brief Creates an ar marker with the id specified using a modified version of the hamming code.
    * There are two type of markers: a) These of 10 bits b) these of 3 bits. The latter are employed for applications
    * that need few marker but they must be small.  The two type of markers are distinguished by their ids. While the first type
    * of markers have ids in the interval [0-1023], the second type ids in the interval [2000-2006].
    *
    *
    * 10 bits markers
    * -----------------------
    * There are a total of 5 rows of 5 cols. Each row encodes a total of 2 bits, so there are 2^10 bits:(0-1023).
    *
    * The least significative bytes are first (from left-up to to right-bottom)
    *
    * Example: the id = 110 (decimal) is be represented in binary as : 00 01 10 11 10.
    *
    * Then, it will generate the following marker:
    *
    * -# 1st row encodes 00: 1 0 0 0 0 : hex 0x10
    * -# 2nd row encodes 01: 1 0 1 1 1 : hex 0x17
    * -# 3nd row encodes 10: 0 1 0 0 1 : hex 0x09
    * -# 4th row encodes 11: 0 1 1 1 0 : hex 0x0e
    * -# 5th row encodes 10: 0 1 0 0 1 : hex 0x09
    *
    * Note that : The first bit, is the inverse of the hamming parity. This avoids the 0 0 0 0 0 to be valid
    * These marker are detected by the function  getFiduciadlMarker_Aruco_Type1
    * @param writeIdWaterMark if true, writes a watermark with the marker id
